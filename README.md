In this exercise, we consider a M/M/2/3 queue with servers having identical service rates.

a) Draw the Markov chain associated to this M/M/2/3 queue. Label all the states and transitions clearly. (4

b) Let Xt be the random variable describing the state of the queue at time t, and assume the queue is in a Assignment Project Exam Help state i at time t. Let us consider a small time step Œît, such that Œît is very small in comparison to the average time between arrivals and Œît is very small in comparison to the mean service times of the queue.

Give the transition probability matrix P(Œît) associated to this M/M/2/3 queue. We recall that we can define

The transition rate matrix Q associated to a continuous time Markov chain can be defined as

p‚Äôt = pt¬∑Q

where p‚Äôt is the time derivative of pt and pt corresponds to a row vector containing the state probabilities at time t. If the chain contains n states then pt = ( Pr(Xt=0), Pr(Xt=1), ‚Ä¶ ,Pr(Xt=n) ) and Q is an nxn matrix. Using the transition probability matrix computed in the previous question, we can also define Q as Q = limŒît‚Üí00 (P-I)/Œît where I is the identity matrix.

d) Use p‚Äôt = pt¬∑Q to find a system of linear equations involving the state probabilities in the steady-state for

ATM switches have a fixed service time duration. A queue in an ATM switch is found to have a Poisson arrival process. Over a long period of time, the average length of the queue is found to be 2.5 packets. Find the fraction of time the queue is empty.

Consider the Jackson network shown below where all nodes are M/M/1. The arrival rate of external traffic to nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are shown on the diagram. Also routing information is shown on each link. Assume that the service rates are as follows: Œº1 = 16, Œº2 = 32, Œº3 = 40, Œº4 = 20, Œº5 = 28.
